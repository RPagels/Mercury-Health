# Mercury Health 2020

The Mercury Health Core development team has embraced a DevOps approach and is using continuous integration for builds and unit tests. If everything passes they use release management for continuous deployment that deploys to various environments and runs UI automation and load tests from coast to coast. During the deployment to the QA environment a few of the UI tests failed and a bug was created. A developer on the team investigates and confirms the bug and breaks down the work into tasks.
